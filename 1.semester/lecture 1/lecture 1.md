## GPTs:
- You should not need GPTs for now, it is good to learn the basics from documentation.
- Don't be impatient, they will get handy soon.
- Don't cheat, you are here willingly. However, discussions with friends is encouraged. If you are lost, let some GPT explain it. I strongly recommend Claude by Anthropic. For now, always use socratic method, in which GPT will not give you the answer, but help you to figure it out. I recommend the Khan academy book. If you feel stuck, go to Khan Academy, e.g. [these lectures](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/intro-to-python-fundamentals).

Ask me during the lectures to explain anything, it is easy to get lost during the explanation.

## On presenting
- Go through the code in notebooks, jump to terminal to show how to write the code from scratch and how run the code from there.
- At the end, summarize the lecture, and give a homework assignment. Today, it is only to test ReCodEx, so they will do it in the lecture.
