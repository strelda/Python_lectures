    "2. Card values are `2,3,...,10, J, Q, K, A`. You can write a dictionary with `keys` as a **string card value**, and `values` as the **integer value of the card** ($J=11$ etc). Such as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "card_values = {'A': 14, 'K': 13, 'Q': 12, 'J': 11, 'T': 10, '9': 9, \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement methods for comparing cards $<, >, ==$, with `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__eq__` resp. This should just implement the function which looks into the `card_values` dictionary and compares the `values` of the cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can use the `sorted` function to sort a list of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a `__hash__` method, so you can use the `set()` function to create a set from the list of cards. This will remove duplicates."
