    "- This is an example, where we don't have to stick to the fixed point theorem from the syntactical point of view. For the base case we can return just one number (the result), whilst the function always accepts two numbers. It is still a fixed point, but we prefer human readable way.\n",

    "Implement a [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm. The algorithm should accept the list and return its sorted version. The functionality is as follows:\n",
    "- If the list is empty, return an empty list.\n",
    "- Else insert the first element into the sorted version of the rest of the list.\n",

    "                                                                 |\n",
    "                                                                 V\n",
    "                                                               insert 2 into sort([]), which is [] from the base case\n",
    "```\n",
    "From this you write onto your wishlist for functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sort(l: list) -> list\n",
    "    \"\"\"Sorts the list l in ascending order.\"\"\"\n",
    "insert(x, l: list) -> list\n",
    "    \"\"\"Inserts a number x into a sorted list l to keep it sorted.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let the `insert` function be also implemented using recursion, with\n",
    "- base case: if the list is empty or x<= the first element in list, ...\n",
    "- recursive case: concatenate the first element of the list with insert(x, rest of the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can follow the design recipe."
